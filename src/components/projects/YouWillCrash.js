        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>The aim of the game is to avoid the obstacles for as long as possible by moving the player around the screen. Every object has a unique and unpredictable behavior that makes every stage challenging and entertaining. The object combinations are randomly generated as well as each objectâ€™s position, velocity and direction.</p>

        <h3>Technology used</h3>
        <p><strong>Corona SDK </strong>is a free 2D game engine programmed in Lua which suited the idea I had in mind, so I learned Lua to make the concept and created all the graphics in Inkscape.</p>
        <h3>Features</h3>
        <p><strong>Endless game: </strong> the game progresses through a series of stages that have unique combinations of objects</p>
        <p><strong>Autobalancing difficulty: </strong>since each object has a different behavior, the amount of objects per stage depends on the difficulty of the combination. </p>
        <p><strong>Power ups</strong> can be bought with dots collected in-game. They can slow down time for 5 seconds, start at stage 3, have an extra life, and </p>
        <p><strong>Leaderboards and achievements</strong> served by Google Play Games.</p>
